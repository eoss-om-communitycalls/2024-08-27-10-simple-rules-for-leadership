    "text": "[To the initial contributors from the Community Call: We have taken the notes from the call, interpreted them, and come up with this “10 Simple Rules” style piece on leading projects in the absence of formal authority. Please take a look and edit any and all parts of it– this did not take us long, and we are not at all married to the list of rules or the descriptions. We welcome additions, revisions, exclusions, wholesale destruction… anything that better captures our conversation and will be useful to the broader open science community.]\nThis set of simple rules is applicable to open organizations that rely on contributors who may have other jobs or responsibilities, may work across various organizations, and otherwise are not obligated to contribute to the open effort. In managing these organizations, a substantial amount of “cat herding”1 is involved: Contributors and community members are not working under a formal authority structure that enables compliance-gaining to be as simple as rules and policies. Instead, a bottom-up approach to leadership is needed, where behavior is encouraged via alternative methods to “stick and carrots.”\n1 Cat herding is an idiomatic English term related to organizing a group of people or entities that are not predisposed to being herded, such as cats. It is often used to talk about groups of individuals who don’t necessarily have a reason to “herd” being shepherded toward a common purpose or direction.These rules are imagined as rules for leaders working across organizations, though they can also be useful within larger organizations when no formal authority is held over participants. Inside of organizations it is important to be aware of existing power structures and how this kind of leading without formal authority can sometimes cause friction with those structures. Furthermore, leading in this way is very difficult: It requires resources, skill development, sensitivity to contributors’ and community members’ realities, navigation of existing organizational structures and social networks, and other demands. These “rules” are therefore more like guidelines or a toolkit to consult in developing this method of leadership.\n\nEstablish and overcommunicate the project’s mission and vision2\n\nThe project’s mission and vision are what people / contributors come for.\n\nArticulating a mission or vision can be the work of both someone inside of a formal structure and also a leader who brings people together.\n\nIn some cases, leaders must build consensus on what the mission/vision should be or how it should change. This is particularly true when small groups establish an organization together around a common goal.\n\n\nLead by example, both in doing the technical work and creating culture\n\nDoing the work alongside the community will be noticed.\n\nSupport and empower people to do the work they want to do. Giving other people the opportunity to be a leader lets them learn as they do.\n\nStart with the assumption that the leader doesn’t have authority over anyone but authority is given to them through the community. The community will keep leadership accountable by deciding whether or not to contribute to the project.\n\nConsider the leadership qualities you most want and decide how to convey those. For example, the qualities of kindness and directness can be modeled.\n\n\nAlign incentives for contribution and participation\n\nConsider what the real incentives are for people to contribute / participate.\n\nWhat do they gain from participation and engagement?\n\nHow do incentives advance your project and the people who are contributing at the same time?\n\nDifferent contributors may have different incentives.\n\n\nWin-win wins are more stable than just win-wins.\n\nExample: A software project benefits from the contributions of an academic researcher whose research benefits from the software and industry/government benefits from the science (who may then further fund the project).\n\nFunding flywheels such as sustainment loops that create virtuous cycles as each party moves things forward. For example:\n\nSoftware - gains features.\n\nGovernment - gains standards and interoperability.\n\nIndustry - gains financial benefits and requests more features.\n\n\nRequires more compromise on the part of all parties.\n\nPrevents people running off with resources.\n\n\n\nCreate agency for your community members\n\nHelp contributors find meaningful work for the project you’re working on.\n\nOptimize the time of those who are working with you.\n\nBe conscious of how you use community member’s time.\n\n\nDraw on the reasons for contribution to create agency among the community.\n\nWork to understand how your community can support the career growth, professional growth, personal growth, and technical skill development of its members.\n\nActively work to remove barriers to contribution, from structural to practical. Examples include:\n\nHelping potential contributors acquire necessary resources, such as Internet connectivity.\n\nProtecting underresourced contributor time (e.g., via honoraria).\n\nMaking contribution accessible across languages.\n\n\nCreate and communicate onboarding processes.\n\nCreate accountability mechanisms for community members to give constructive feedback safely about their experience in the community.\n\nDevelop avenues for implementing this feedback into leadership and community decisions.\n\n\n\nIntentionally build THIS group’s “culture”\n\nActively build norms by talking openly about how they connect to the mission and vision.\n\nDocument norms in ways that are accessible and digestible for the community.\n\nRevisit documented norms regularly to revise based on changes in the community.\n\n\nEnlist respected people to model and uphold the norms.\n\nCollectively hold the community’s expectations and guidelines. For example:\n\nCode of Conduct committee vs. project lead’s’s sole responsibility over “violations.”\n\nMake contribution guidelines clear and findable.\n\n\nDevelop graduated sanctions for any violations.\n\nConsider how to keep people engaged as they learn the norms / rules.\n\nWhen possible, involve the community in the development of graduated sanctions.\n\n\n\nFoster inclusivity\n\nPsychological safety is paramount.\n\nKnow what you don’t want in your group’s dynamics and be sure to bring up things like toxic behavior and in group behaviors that can be exclusionary.\n\nDon’t underestimate the people you already have access to, they have skills and abilities to draw from.\n\n\nEmpower others in the group\n\nCreate pathways for community members to advance into leadership roles and ensure they are explicitly documented and findable.\n\nEncourage people to step up and do more than even they might know they can do, when they are interested in doing more and have the bandwidth (i.e., don’t overburden people).\n\n\nListen and adapt to develop contributor motivation\n\nStart where people are.\n\nWhat do they actually want out of this engagement?\n\nWhat do you want / need out of their contributions?\n\nUnderstand that individuals’ professional / personal lives change, and so too might their motivation and availability.\n\n\nMake it easy\n\nIf you want people to join you, make it easy to join.\n\nIf you would like money, make it easy to pay you.\n\nTo communicate, make the communication accessible, simple, digestible, and understandable. Joining a community should not require substantial investment.\n\n\nExpect and prepare for community turnover\n\nWork to cultivate an environment that seeks to prevent contributor burnout\n\nPeople will need to leave/do other things, this is not a bad thing. If they still think fondly of you when they leave, it’s good for the group (e.g., they may spread positive information about your project)\n\nManaging turnover - if you’re already anticipating that people will leave, your systems/workflows will reflect that\n\nOffboarding processes should be top-of-mind: Intentionally design and regularly update processes, including by reaching out to formerly active community members\n\nBe welcoming when people come back!\n\n\n2 We use “mission and vision” to refer to the set of high-level text used to define an organization, which can include a mission statement, a vision statement, a purpose statement, a values statement, etc.\n\nThis resource was generated as part of CZI’s EOSS Community Calls during late 2024 with Organizational Mycology facilitating discussions, gathering input, and generating the final document.
