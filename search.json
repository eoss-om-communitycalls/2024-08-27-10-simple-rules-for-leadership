In managing these organizations, a substantial amount of ‚Äúcat herding‚Äù1 is involved: Contributors and community members are not working under a formal authority structure that enables compliance-gaining to be as simple as rules and policies. Instead, a bottom-up approach to leadership is needed, where behavior is encouraged via alternative methods to ‚Äústick and carrots.‚Äù\nThese rules are imagined as rules for leaders working across organizations, though they can also be useful within larger organizations when no formal authority is held over participants. Inside of organizations it is important to be aware of existing power structures and how this kind of leading without formal authority can sometimes cause friction with those structures. Furthermore, leading in this way is very difficult: It requires resources, skill development, sensitivity to contributors‚Äô and community members‚Äô realities, navigation of existing organizational structures and social networks, and other demands. These ‚Äúrules‚Äù are therefore more like guidelines or a toolkit to consult in developing this method of leadership."
