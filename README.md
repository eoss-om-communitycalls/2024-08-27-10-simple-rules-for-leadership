#     2024-08-27-10-simple-rules-for-leadership

This set of simple rules is applicable to open organizations that rely on contributors who may have other jobs or responsibilities, may work across various organizations, and are not obligated to contribute to the open effort. In managing these organizations, a substantial amount of “cat herding” is involved: Contributors and community members are not working under a formal authority structure that enables compliance-gaining to be as simple as rules and policies. Instead, a bottom-up approach to leadership is needed, where behavior is encouraged via alternative methods to “stick and carrots.”

These rules are imagined as rules for leaders working across organizations, though they can also be useful within larger organizations when no formal authority is held over participants. Inside of organizations it is important to be aware of existing power structures and how this kind of leading without formal authority can sometimes cause friction with those structures. Furthermore, leading in this way is very difficult: It requires resources, skill development, sensitivity to contributors’ and community members’ realities, navigation of existing organizational structures and social networks, and other demands. These “rules” are therefore more like guidelines or a toolkit to consult in developing this method of leadership.

We encourage suggestions and contributions to expand the scope of issues that open source project leaders should consider when developing their leadership skills, as well as resources that would be helpful to leaders and their projects.

When making a contribution, please add your name to the list of contributors.
